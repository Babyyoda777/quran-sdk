            #HifdhTip:
            Strive for utmost sincerity.
            Regularly renew your intention.
	        You\'re not in this to show off or for worldly gains.
        </item>

            #HifdhTip:
            Repetition, repetition, repetition.
            There are no shortcuts in memorising the #Quran.
            Continuous repetition is key.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Dedicate at least 30 minutes every day for memorising the #Quran.
            This is easily possible.
            Remember that there are people who recite and review the #Quran for several hours a day.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Begin your memorisation journey with a small and realistic goal.
            Build upon it steadily.
            Moderation is better than an overwhelming goal that causes you to give up.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Learn the proper pronunciation of the Arabic letters.
            But do not let this stop you from memorising.
            Work on both simultaneously.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Protect your eyes from looking at that which is impermissible.
            Protect your tongue from saying that which is sinful.
            Be conscious of Allah and Allah will teach you.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Trust in Allah.
            Memorising and retaining the #Quran is a monumental task.
            But do your best and Allah will take care of the rest.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Never let a day go by in which you do not revise some #Quran.
            Regardless of your weekly of monthly target,
            have a minimum amount that you absolutely must revise every day.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            If you fall short of your memorisation or revision target on a given day,
            force yourself to do a little more the next day.
            Consistency is key.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Clear your mind from any worries or thoughts that will distract you.
            Seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan.
            Then proceed in the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Listening to the #Quran frequently,
            whether from people or recordings,
            will engrave it into your mind and heart.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Listening to the #Quran being recited,
            whether from people or recordings,
            will help you catch any mistakes in your memorisation.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Record your recitation of #Quran and listen to the recording.
            This will help you find mistakes and improve your articulation of the verses.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Read the translation of each verse that you memorise and try to connect the words with their meanings.
            Understanding the words will help you learn and remember.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Use the same Mus-haf (printed copy of the #Quran) every time you memorise and recite.
            This will help your mind visually recall where particular verses begin and end.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Recite aloud.
            It will help you catch mistakes that you would miss when reciting in your head.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Memorise consecutive parts of the #Quran
            rather than jumping around different parts.
            This will make it easier to regularly review what you know.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            There is no best time for memorising and revising the #Quran that applies to everyone.
            Nevertheless, the most recommended time is after #Fajr prayer.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Memorising with others is highly recommended.
            Recite what you know to a teacher, family member or friend regularly.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Writing out verses is one of the best ways to help you remember them.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Recite the verses of #Quran that you have memorised in your prayers.
            Avoid reciting the same sequence of verses again and again in every prayer
            out of laziness or lack of confidence.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Being in a state of purity when reciting #Quran is highly recommended
            in order to achieve the full blessing of Allah,
            efficiency of the deed,
            and protection against the devils.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Before learning a new verse,
            recite the last few words of the previous verse.
            This will help you better remember the connection between verses.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Make a commitment to learn Arabic.
            This will help you learn verses faster,
            remember them better
            and understand them on a deeper level.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Have a plan to regularly go over all of the verses that you have memorised.
            For example, once a week or once a month, depending on how much you know.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Beware of reviewing your memorisation at a rapid speed for the sake of completing the words.
            Concentrate and reflect on the meanings.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            Teach others.
            The one who teaches the #Quran is likely to remember it,
            at times even more than the one being taught.
        </item>

        <item>
            #HifdhTip:
            When revising a page, recite it at least once without looking at the Mus-haf
            (printed copy of the #Quran).
            This will strengthen your memory and decrease your dependence on the Mus-haf.
