            #HifdhTip:
            Learn the proper pronunciation of the Arabic letters.
            But do not let this stop you from memorising.
            Work on both simultaneously.

            #HifdhTip:
            Protect your eyes from looking at that which is impermissible.

            If you fall short of your memorisation or revision target on a given day,

            #HifdhTip:
            Use the same Mus-haf (i.e. printed copy of the #Quran) every time you memorise and recite.
